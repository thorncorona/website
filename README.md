# thorncorona.github.io - Personal website

Personal website built using gulp, handlebars, bootstrap 3, and scss.
 
Running `gulp` compiles scss, handlebars templates, and javascript into a `dist` directory. It then watches the source folders for changes to re-compile if needed.

`gulp deploy` deploys the distribution to the `gh-pages` branch on this repo.

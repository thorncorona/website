I learned a lot doing this assignment because in the process of creating my four year plan, I realized I wanted to also look into learning more about electrical engineering. As a result, I added the CS351 and EE215 courses to my course plan to try out EE. It was very cool to explore the course catalog and see the variety of different courses UW offered.</th></tr><tr><th><a href="h100-peer-interview.pdf" target="_blank">H100 Peer Interview</a></th><th>This is the experiential interview that I did in Honors 100. The assignment was to interview a peer and then using the interests I discovered about them, suggest several experiential learning opportunities. I enjoyed learning about Christina and her interests during this assignment because it was the first person I met who wanted to do design or journalism. I felt like I was more connected to the Honors community because I didn't know anybody else doing honors.</th></tr><tr><th><a href="cs143-grammar-solver.zip" target="_blank">CS143 Grammar Solver Project</a></th><th>This is the grammar solver assignment that I did in CSE 143. It works by using grammar rules recorded in Backus-Naur form, and comparing those rules to the current sentence. Each word is chosen in the sentence based on the word type in the grammar. I'm enjoying my CS143 class because I'm learning a lot about how computers use very simple data structures in order to build up to very complex problems. In this case, it surprised me how simple it was to programmatically construct complex sentences.</th></tr><tr><th><a href="h100-a6-final-reflection.pdf" target="_blank">Honors 100 Final Reflection</a></th><th>A final reflection about my first quarter here at UW. I talk about my classes along with settling into living at the dorms. I found reflecting more helpful than I originally anticipated.</th></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="container-canvas"></div><script src="/js/libs/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/libs/jquery.particleground.min.js"></script><script src="/js/main.js"></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-113286688-1"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
